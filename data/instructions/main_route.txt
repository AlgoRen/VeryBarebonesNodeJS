Welcome to the ZBK API!

How To Use ZBK API:
This API utilizes two main routing options '/weather' 
to get weather data and '/location' to get location data.

ZBK's '/weather/all' route may be called to return all available weather data or
you may call '/weather/{city}' where {city} equals the city of your choice.
Other examples include '/weather/{city}/hour?time={0-23} and 
'/weather/{city}/hours?from={0-23}&to={0-23}' to get more specific weather data.
To know more about these weather routes do a GET request to:
'/weather/hour' or 'weather/hours'.

Enjoy and have fun using the ZBK UI!
