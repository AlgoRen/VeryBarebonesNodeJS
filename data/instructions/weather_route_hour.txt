General Overview of the /weather route within ZBK's API:
To get a quick example of the data that ZBK's /weather route send a GET request
to  '/weather/all'. This returns all weather data currently stored.

To get weather data pertaining to a specific city send a GET request to route 
'weather/city/{name}' replace {name} with the city name of your choice. 
NOTE: Currently only supports one city, Apopka. Hahahaha XD

How to use the weather/hour route:
Send GET requests only!
To get weather data for a specific hour attach the parameter time={0-23} to the
end of hour and replace {0-23} with a numerical number between 0 and 23. The 
time parameter use a 24 hour clock. An example of a call: 
'weather/hour?time=23' 
...this will get all data ZBK has for that hour. Or you may call:
'weather/city/apopka/hour?time=23' to get that hour's weather in that city, as
only one city is currently supported both GET request will send the same data.
