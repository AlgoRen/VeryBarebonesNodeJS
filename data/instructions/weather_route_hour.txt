<h1>General Overview of the /weather route within ZBK's API:</h1>
To get a quick example of ZBK's /weather route, send a GET request
to '/weather/all'. This route returns all weather data currently stored.

To get weather data for a specific city send, a GET request to route 
'weather/city/{name}' replace {name} with the city name of your choice. 
NOTE: Currently only has hardcoded data for one city, Apopka. 

<h2>How to use the weather/hour route:</h2>
<h3>Send GET requests only!</h3>
To get weather data for a specific hour, attach the parameter time={0-23} to the end of
hour and replace {0-23} with a numerical number between 0 and 23. The time parameter 
uses a 24-hour clock. An example of a call: 
'weather/hour?time=23' 
this will get all data ZBK has for that hour. Or you may call:
'weather/hour?time=23' 
to get that hour's weather data.
All returned data is hardcoded data for the city of Apopka. An update with the 
capability and data of retrieving other cities is in development.
