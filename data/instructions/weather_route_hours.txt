<h1>General Overview of the /weather route within ZBK's API:</h1>
To get a quick example of ZBK's /weather route, send a GET request
to '/weather/all'. This route returns all weather data currently stored.

To get weather data for a specific city send, a GET request to route 
'weather/city/{name}' replace {name} with the city name of your choice. 
NOTE: Currently only has hardcoded data for one city, Apopka. 

<h2>How to use the weather/hours route:</h2>
<h3>Send GET requests only!</h3>
To get weather data for specific hours attach the parameter from={0-23} followed by 
the '&' sign followed by to={0-23} to get weather data between those hours. Both the 
from and to parameter are inclusive. The from and to parameter uses a 24-hour clock. 
An example of a call: 
'weather/hours?from=19&to=23' 
this will get all data ZBK has for those hours (7:00 pm to 11:59 pm). Or you may call:
'weather/hours?from=19' 
to get weather starting at 19:00 (7:00 pm) till the end of the day at 23:59 (11:59 pm). 
If there is no to parameter, missing, or wrong to value, then a to parameter is created
and set to a default of 23 will be set.
All returned data is hardcoded data for the city of Apopka. An update with the 
capability and data of retrieving other cities is in development.
