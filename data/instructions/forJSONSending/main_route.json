{"message": "Welcome to the ZBK API! How To Use ZBK API: This API utilizes two main routing options '/weather' to get weather data and '/location' to get location data. ZBK's '/weather/all' route may be called to return all available weather data or you may call '/weather/city/{name}' where {name} equals the city of your choice. Other examples include '/weather/city={name}/hour?time={0-23} and '/weather/city/{name}/hours?from={0-23}&to={0-23}' to get more specific weather data. To know more about these weather routes do a GET request to: '/weather/hour' or 'weather/hours'. Enjoy and have fun using the ZBK UI! Created by Algo Ren."}
