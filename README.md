# Welcome to ZBK's Backend with Vanilla NodeJs
## Purpose
### ***The purpose*** of this application is to create a very barebones version of **ZBK's Backend** functionality using only Vanilla *NodeJS*, no Express, so to do this; we are making a very simple *REST API*. Our REST API will receive query params for location and timeframe data and return the correct weather data. ~~Our API will also receive JSON data for obstacle type, level of difficulty range, and city to return locations that meet the specifications.~~

## Objective
### ***The primary objective*** is to create a server that runs a RESTful API that can receive location and timeframe data within a URL and return the correct weather data stored within our data folder.

### ~~***The Secondary objective*** is to create a server that runs a RESTful API that can receive a 'level of difficulty' (numerical), 'obstacle type' (text) and 'city name' (text) data within the request's body. Once received, return the correct location data stored within our data folder that match the set conditions.~~

## Update
### A change has been made to the purpose of this application. I have decided to limit this REST API to return weather data only for the following reasons:
#### 1) The amount of time spent organizing the proper routing without Express was more than expected. 
#### 2) I will be using the features of this application in a personal product and would like to protect some of my intellectual property.
#### 3) I will be making this API again using Express so I rather not have to do too much of what I will have to do twice. If I decide to make that project public I will provide a link to it here.
