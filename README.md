# Welcome to ZBK's Backend with Vanilla NodeJs
## Purpose
### ***The purpose*** of this application is to create a very barebones version of **ZBK's Backend** functionality using only Vanilla *NodeJS*, no Express, so to do this; we are making a very simple *REST API*. Our REST API will receive query params for location and timeframe data and return the correct weather data. Our API will also receive JSON data for obstacle type, level of difficulty range, and city to return locations that meet the specifications.

## Objective
### ***The primary objective*** is to create a server that runs a RESTful API that can receive location and timeframe data within a URI and return the correct weather data stored within our data folder.

### ***The Secondary objective*** is to create a server that runs a RESTful API that can receive a 'level of difficulty' (numerical), 'obstacle type' (text) and 'city name' (text) data within the request's body. Once received, return the correct location data stored within our data folder that match the set conditions.
